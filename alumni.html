		The alumni meet and greet is a fantastic way for current students to meet
		with older ones and talk with someone who was recently in their position as
		an ECE student here at UCSD. Alumni will get to meet up with each other and
		reconnect with the school, and present students will get to talk with them
		about their time here at UCSD and what they found most beneficial to their
		experiences in industry.
