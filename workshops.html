		The workshops are a great way for students to exercise their ECE knowledge
		and introduce them to real world applications of material they learn in
		class. These short workshops are designed for anyone to be able to complete,
		regardless of technical experience, but they will serve as a great way for
		students interested in ECE to jump right into the field.
